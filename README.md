A set of Removable USB disk based virus remover

Foreword
Yeah I know there's already tons of removers tool out there that does a better job in removing and disinfecting your PC but why not have fun and do your own?

Summary of what it does
It scans for inserted removable USB drive then it will perform scanning (in each removable drive) of hidden files or folders by possibly a virus, then it will also try to disable any hidden executable that might be a virus and lastly remove any shortcut which leads to the virus.

So basically it search and disable a removable drive virus but for prevention.
